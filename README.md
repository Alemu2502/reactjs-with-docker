### Setup and Installation

Prerequisites
1. Node.js and npm installed
2. Git installed
3. Installation Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Alemu2502/reactjs-portfolio.git

cd reactjs-portfolio

Install dependencies:

npm install

### Running the Project

Development Mode
To run the project in development mode:

npm start

Production Build
To create a production build: 

npm run build

### CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

 # The CI/CD pipeline includes steps for:

1. Checking out the code
2. Caching Node modules
3. Setting up Node.js
4. Installing dependencies
5. Running tests (commented out for now)
6. Building the project
7. Deploying to Netlify

### Deployment

The frontend is deployed using Netlify. The deployment configuration is handled in the GitHub Actions workflow.

### Environment Variables

Frontend (set in Netlify): In this project, i utilize several environment variables to 
maintain consistency and manage configurations. These variables include both essential 
service identifiers and social media links. While the social media links are stored in 
the environment file for consistency, they are intended to be publicly accessible. 
If you prefer, you can use them as public values.

Here are the environment variables used:

 VITE_SERVICE_ID
 VITE_TEMPLATE_ID
 VITE_USER_ID
 VITE_GITHUB
 VITE_FACEBOOK
 VITE_LINKEDIN
 VITE_TWITTER

To set these variables in Netlify, you can navigate to the site's settings and add them under the "Build & Deploy" section.

### Emailjs Integration

EmailJS Integration

Overview

This project utilizes EmailJS to handle the contact form submissions. EmailJS allows you to send emails directly from your JavaScript code without needing a server.

Why EmailJS?

No Server Required: 
EmailJS provides a serverless solution to send emails from your client-side application.

Easy Setup:
 With minimal configuration, you can integrate EmailJS and start sending emails.

Secure: 
EmailJS handles the email sending process securely, so you don't need to expose your SMTP credentials.

Setup and Integration
Follow these steps to integrate EmailJS with your contact form:

Create an Account: If you don't have an EmailJS account, sign up here. https://dashboard.emailjs.com/sign-up

Create a New Email Service:

After logging in, go to the Email Services section and create a new email service.

Add your email provider (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) and connect it.

Create an Email Template:

Navigate to the Email Templates section and create a new template.

Define the template parameters and structure (e.g., subject, body).

Get Your User ID(public key), Service ID, and Template ID:

Go to the Integration section and copy your User ID.

Note down your Service ID and Template ID from the Email Services and Templates sections, respectively.

Add Environment Variables:

Set the following environment variables in your project (e.g., in Netlify's Build & Deploy settings):

plaintext

 VITE_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
 VITE_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
 VITE_USER_ID=your_user_id

and add all your social media links here if you prefer
 Install EmailJS in Your Project:

 Install the EmailJS SDK:

 npm install emailjs-com

 Implement the Contact Form:

 In your contact form component, import and configure EmailJS:

javascript
import emailjs from 'emailjs-com';

const sendEmail = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  emailjs.sendForm('your_service_id', 'your_template_id', e.target, 'your_user_id')
    .then((result) => {
      console.log(result.text);
    }, (error) => {
      console.log(error.text);
    });
};

<form onSubmit={sendEmail}>
  <!-- Your form fields here -->
  <input type="submit" value="Send" />
</form>

Testing

Local Testing: 
Run your project locally and test the contact form to ensure it sends emails correctly.

Deployed Testing: 

After deploying your project (e.g., on Netlify), test the contact form again to ensure it works in the live environment.
